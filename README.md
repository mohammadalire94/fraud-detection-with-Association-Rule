# Fraud Detection using Basket Problem and Association Rules
Welcome to the Fraud Detection project using the Basket Problem and Association Rules! This project focuses on utilizing association rules to tackle fraud detection by transforming the classic basket problem into a fraud detection problem.
## Introduction
Fraud detection is a critical task in various industries, including finance, e-commerce, and insurance. Traditional methods often rely on supervised learning techniques, but in this project, we approach the problem from a unique angle using association rules. By framing the problem as a basket problem, we aim to identify patterns that indicate fraudulent behavior and distinguish it from normal transactions.
## How it Works
The project leverages the Apriori algorithm to extract association rules from the dataset. The Apriori algorithm is a classic algorithm in data mining, specifically designed to find frequent itemsets and association rules. By transforming the fraud detection problem into a basket problem, we are able to identify sets of items (features) that frequently co-occur together, signifying potential fraud patterns.
